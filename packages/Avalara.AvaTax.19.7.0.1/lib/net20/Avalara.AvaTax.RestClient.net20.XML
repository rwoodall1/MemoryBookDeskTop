            <remarks>
            Resets the existing license key for this account to a new key.
             
            To reset your account, you must specify the ID of the account you wish to reset and confirm the action.
             
            This API is only available to account administrators for the account in question, and may only be called after
            an account has been activated by reading and accepting Avalara's terms and conditions. To activate your account
            please log onto the AvaTax website or call the `ActivateAccount` API.
             
            Resetting a license key cannot be undone. Any previous license keys will immediately cease to work when a new key is created.
             
            When you call this API, all account administrators for this account will receive an email with the newly updated license key.
            The email will specify which user reset the license key and it will contain the new key to use to update your connectors.

            Because the batch system processes with a degree of concurrency, and
            because of batch sizes in the queue vary, AvaTax API is unable to accurately

            Companies that do not have this storage system set up will receive the error `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
            certificate related APIs. To check if this company is set up, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of the auditable document
            storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.

            Examines the most recent 100 transactions or data from the last month when verifying transaction-related integrations.
            For partners who write integrations against AvaTax for many clients, this API is a way to do a quick self testing to verify whether the
            written integrations for a company are sufficient enough to be delivered to the respective customers to start using it.
             
            This API provides messages specific enough (through predefined checks) to guide the partner on what integrations are still missing from the company to get fully certified.
            The API makes the following checks to conclude if the company is NOT fully certified:
            1. Any past month items contains generic tax code of P0000000.
            2. All the companies on the requesting account are test companies.
            3. No Voided/Cancelled documents in the past 30 days.
            4. There are less than 2 committed documents.
            5. Any documentCode is a generic GUID string.
            6. Any customerCode on document is a generic GUID string.
            7. No document has more than 1 documentLine.
            8. All of the documents have missing exemptionNo, customerUsageType, taxDateOverride or negative amount.
            9. Any document quantity is a negative number.
            10. Any document have repeated lines.
            11. No document has shipping charge.
            12. All documents have same ItemCodes, descriptions and taxCodes.
            13. Less than 2 addresses used across all documents.
            14. Whether locationCode was used in documents.
            15. Account with AvaGlobal subscription and no documents have VATBuyerId.

            Company settings are permanent settings that cannot be deleted. You can set the value of a
            company setting to null if desired and if the particular setting supports it.
             
            Avalara-based company settings for `AvaCertServiceConfig` affect your company's exemption certificate
            processing, and should be changed with care.

            record in your `CreateTransaction` API call. AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and
            identify any certificates linked to this `customer` object. If any certificate applies to the transaction,
            AvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.
             
            A nested object such as CustomFields could be specified and created along with the customer object. To fetch the
            nested object, please call 'GetCustomer' API with appropriate $include parameters.
             
            Using exemption certificates endpoints requires setup of an auditable document storage for each company that will use certificates.

            Customer records represent businesses or individuals who can provide exemption certificates. Some customers
            may have certificates that are linked to their shipping address or their billing address. To group these
            customer records together, you may link multiple bill-to and ship-to addresses together to represent a single
            entity that has multiple different addresses of different kinds.
             
            In general, a customer will have only one primary billing address and multiple ship-to addresses, representing
            all of the different locations where they receive goods. To facilitate this type of customer, you can send in
            one bill-to customer code and multiple ship-to customer codes in a single API call.
             
            Note that you can only link a ship-to customer record to a bill-to customer record. You may not link two customers
            of the same kind together.

            A customer object defines information about a person or business that purchases products from your
            company. When you create a tax transaction in AvaTax, you can use the `customerCode` from this
            record in your `CreateTransaction` API call. AvaTax will search for this `customerCode` value and
            identify any certificates linked to this `customer` object. If any certificate applies to the transaction,
            AvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.
             
            Using exemption certificates endpoints requires setup of an auditable document storage for each company that will use certificates.
            Companies that do not have this storage system set up will receive the error `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption
            certificate related APIs. To check if this company is set up, call `GetCertificateSetup`. To request setup of the auditable document
            storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.

            It is intended to allow you to create a "Jurisdiction Override", which allows an address to be configured as belonging to a nearby
            jurisdiction in AvaTax.
             
            The results of this API call can be passed to the `CreateJurisdictionOverride` API call.

            Retrieves a list of nexus related to a tax form.
             
            The concept of `Nexus` indicates a place where your company has sufficient physical presence and is obligated
            to collect and remit transaction-based taxes.
             
            When defining companies in AvaTax, you must declare nexus for your company in order to correctly calculate tax
            in all jurisdictions affected by your transactions.
             
            This API is intended to provide useful information when examining a tax form. If you are about to begin filing
            a tax form, you may want to know whether you have declared nexus in all the jurisdictions related to that tax
            form in order to better understand how the form will be filled out.

            countries.
             
            To select a preferred program for calculating customs and duty rates, call this API to find the appropriate code for your
            preferred program. Next, set the parameter `AvaTax.LC.PreferredProgram` in your `CreateTransaction` call to the code of
            the program.

            team can manage your item catalog and adjust the tax behavior of items without having to modify your software.

            Items are a way of separating your tax calculation process from your tax configuration details. If you choose, you
            can provide `itemCode` values for each `CreateTransaction()` API call rather than specifying tax codes, parameters, descriptions,
            and other data fields. AvaTax will automatically look up each `itemCode` and apply the correct tax codes and parameters
            from the item table instead. This allows your CreateTransaction call to be as simple as possible, and your tax compliance
            team can manage your item catalog and adjust the tax behavior of items without having to modify your software.

            <remarks>
            Records a new MultiDocument transaction in AvaTax.
             
            A traditional transaction requires exactly two parties: a seller and a buyer. MultiDocument transactions can
            involve a marketplace of vendors, each of which contributes some portion of the final transaction. Within
            a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate
            document. This separation of documents allows each seller to file their taxes separately.
             
            This API will report an error if you attempt to create a transaction when one already exists with the specified `code`.
            If you would like the API to automatically update the transaction when it already exists, please set the `allowAdjust`
            value to `true`.
             
            To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
             
            The field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund. If you do not specify
            a `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.
             
            The origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode. For address-based transactions, please
            provide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`. For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode
            information in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`. If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated
            using the best available address location information.
             
            You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

            a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate

            Create a refund for a MultiDocument transaction
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Create a refund for a MultiDocument transaction.
             
            A traditional transaction requires exactly two parties: a seller and a buyer. MultiDocument transactions can
            involve a marketplace of vendors, each of which contributes some portion of the final transaction. Within
            a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate
            document. This separation of documents allows each seller to file their taxes separately.
             
            The `RefundTransaction` API allows you to quickly and easily create a `ReturnInvoice` representing a refund
            for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction. You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
            specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.
             
            The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
            was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
            nexus, or any other setting.
             
            This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following
            common refund scenarios:
             
            * A full refund of a previous sale
            * Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
            * Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
            * Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale
             
            For more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to
            create a custom refund transaction.
             
            You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

            * Details (implies lines)

            Creates one or more new nexus declarations attached to this company.
             
            The concept of Nexus indicates a place where your company is legally obligated to collect and remit transactional
            taxes. The legal requirements for nexus may vary per country and per jurisdiction; please seek advice from your
            accountant or lawyer prior to declaring nexus.
             
            To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
            list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
            only the user-selectable fields in this object.
             
            The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
            `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
             
            When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
            must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
            by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.
             
            Please note that nexus changes may not take effect immediately and you should plan to update your nexus settings in advance
            of calculating tax for a location.

            You may only define nexus matching the official list of declared nexus.

            Replace the existing nexus declaration object at this URL with an updated object.
             
            The concept of Nexus indicates a place where your company is legally obligated to collect and remit transactional
            taxes. The legal requirements for nexus may vary per country and per jurisdiction; please seek advice from your
            accountant or lawyer prior to declaring nexus.
             
            To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
            list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
            only the user-selectable fields in this object.
             
            The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
            `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
             
            When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
            must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
            by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.
             
            Please note that nexus changes may not take effect immediately and you should plan to update your nexus settings in advance
            of calculating tax for a location.

            Avalara invites select partners to refer new customers to the AvaTax service using the onboarding features
            of AvaTax. These partners can create accounts for new customers using this API.
             
            Calling this API creates an account with the specified product subscriptions, but does not configure billing.
            The customer will receive information from Avalara about how to configure billing for their account.
            You should call this API when a customer has requested to begin using Avalara services.
             
            If the newly created account owner wishes, they can confirm that they have read and agree to the Avalara
            terms and conditions. If they do so, they can receive a license key as part of this API and their
            API will be created in `Active` status. If the customer has not yet read and accepted these terms and
            conditions, the account will be created in `New` status and they can receive a license key by logging
            onto the AvaTax website and reviewing terms and conditions online.

            <remarks>
            This API downloads the file associated with a report.
             
            If the report is not yet complete, you will receive a `ReportNotFinished` error. To check if a report is complete,
            use the `GetReport` API.
             
            Reports are run as asynchronous report tasks on the server. When complete, the report file will be available for download
            for up to 30 days after completion. To run an asynchronous report, you should follow these steps:
             
            * Begin a report by calling the report's Initiate API. There is a separate initiate API call for each report type.
            * In the result of the Initiate API, you receive back a report's `id` value.
            * Check the status of a report by calling `GetReport` and passing in the report's `id` value.
            * When a report's status is `Completed`, call `DownloadReport` to retrieve the file.
             
            This API works for all report types.

            If you use this file to provide default tax rates, please ensure that your software calls `CreateTransaction`

            * CITY_USE_TAX - The city component of the use tax rate.
            * TOTAL_SALES_TAX - The total tax rate for sales tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.
            * TOTAL_USE_TAX - The total tax rate for use tax for this postal code. This value may not equal the sum of the state/county/city due to special tax jurisdiction rules.

            Create one or more custom tax rules attached to this company.
             
            A tax rule represents a rule that changes the default AvaTax behavior for a product or jurisdiction. Custom tax rules
            can be used to change the taxability of an item, to change the tax base of an item, or to change the tax rate
            charged when selling an item. Tax rules can also change tax behavior depending on the `entityUseCode` value submitted
            with the transaction.

             The `AddLines` API allows you to add additional transaction lines to existing transaction, so that customer will
             be able to append multiple calls together and form an extremely large transaction. If customer does not specify line number
             in the lines to be added, a new random Guid string will be generated for line number. If customer are not satisfied with
             the line number for the transaction lines, they can turn on the renumber switch to have REST v2 automatically renumber all
             transaction lines for them, in this case, the line number becomes: "1", "2", "3", ...

            This API is available as long as the transaction is in `saved` or `posted` status. When a transaction
            is `committed`, it can be modified by using the [AdjustTransaction](https://developer.avalara.com/api-reference/avatax/rest/v2/methods/Transactions/AdjustTransaction/) method.
             
            After this API call succeeds, the transaction will have a new URL matching its new `code`.
             
            If you have more than one document with the same `code`, specify the `documentType` parameter to choose between them.

            Records a new transaction or adjust an existing transaction in AvaTax.
             
            The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` endpoint is used to create a new transaction or update an existing one. This API
            can help you create an idempotent service that creates transactions
            If there exists a transaction identified by code, the original transaction will be adjusted by using the meta data
            in the input transaction.
             
            The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API cannot modify any transaction that has been reported to a tax authority using
            the Avalara Managed Returns Service or any other tax filing service. If you call this API to attempt to modify
            a transaction that has been reported on a tax filing, you will receive the error `CannotModifyLockedTransaction`.
             
            To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
             
            If you don't specify the field `type` in your request, you will get an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded in the database.

            Records a new transaction in AvaTax.
             
            A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
            sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).
             
            The `CreateTransaction` endpoint uses the tax profile of your company to identify the correct tax rules
            and rates to apply to all line items in this transaction. The end result will be the total tax calculated by AvaTax based on your
            company's configuration and the data provided in this API call.
             
            The `CreateTransaction` API will report an error if a committed transaction already exists with the same `code`. To
            avoid this error, use the `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API - it will create the transaction if it does not exist, or
            update it if it does exist.
             
            To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.
             
            The field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund. If you do not specify
            a `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.
             
            The origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode. For address-based transactions, please
            provide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`. For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode
            information in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`. If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated
            using the best available address location information.
             
            You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

            * TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.
             
            If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

            Create a refund for a transaction

            <remarks>
            Create a refund for a transaction.
             
            The `RefundTransaction` API allows you to quickly and easily create a `ReturnInvoice` representing a refund
            for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction. You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
            specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.
             
            The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
            was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
            nexus, or any other setting.
             
            This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following
            common refund scenarios:
             
            * A full refund of a previous sale
            * Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
            * Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
            * Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale
             
            For more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to
            create a custom refund transaction.
             
            You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:
             
            * Lines
            * Details (implies lines)
            * Summary (implies details)
            * Addresses
            * SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
            * LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
            * TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.
            If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

            <remarks>
            Return a list of all entitlements to which this user has rights to access.
            Entitlements are a list of specified API calls the user is permitted to make, a list of identifier numbers for companies the user is
            allowed to use, and an access level identifier that indicates what types of access roles the user is allowed to use.
            This API call is intended to provide a validation endpoint to determine, before making an API call, whether this call is likely to succeed.
            For example, if user 567 within account 999 is attempting to create a new child company underneath company 12345, you could preview the user's
            entitlements and predict whether this call would succeed:
             
            * Retrieve entitlements by calling '/api/v2/accounts/999/users/567/entitlements' . If the call fails, you do not have accurate
             credentials for this user.
            * If the 'accessLevel' field within entitlements is 'None', the call will fail.
            * If the 'accessLevel' field within entitlements is 'SingleCompany' or 'SingleAccount', the call will fail if the companies
             table does not contain the ID number 12345.
            * If the 'permissions' array within entitlements does not contain 'AccountSvc.CompanySave', the call will fail.
             
            For a full list of defined permissions, please use '/api/v2/definitions/permissions' .

            This API is intended to help you verify that your connection is working. This API will always succeed and will
            never return a error. It provides basic information about the server you connect to:
             
            * `version` - The version number of the AvaTax API server that responded to your request. The AvaTax API version number is updated once per month during Avalara's update process.
            * `authenticated` - A boolean flag indicating whether or not you sent valid credentials with your API request.
            * `authenticationType` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you whether you used Bearer, Username, or LicenseKey authentication.
            * `authenticatedUserName` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the username of the currently logged in user.
            * `authenticatedUserId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will tell you the user ID of the currently logged in user.
            * `authenticatedAccountId` - If you provided valid credentials to the API, this field will contain the account ID of the currently logged in user.
             
            This API helps diagnose connectivity problems between your application and AvaTax; you may call this API even
            if you do not have verified connection credentials. If this API fails, either your computer is not connected to
            the internet, or there is a routing problem between your office and Avalara, or the Avalara server is not available.

             For a return invoice, the `companyCode` of the transaction refers to the seller who is giving the refund
             and the `customerVendorCode` refers to the buyer who is requesting the refund.
             
             This is a permanent document and is recorded in AvaTax.
             
             Please note that many jurisdictions around the United States have special rules about how to report refunds
             on a sales tax filing, and some refund transactions may be unable to file immediately due to credit netting
             rules.

            Represents a type of tax override requested by the customer.
             
             AvaTax allows customers to override some behavior of the AvaTax engine. When you use a
             Tax Override, you can import tax that was previously calculated and charged to the customer exactly
             as it was charged. AvaTax will record the type of override used for each transaction.

        <member name="F:Avalara.AvaTax.RestClient.TaxOverrideType.TaxAmount">
            <summary>
            AvaTax calculated tax for this transaction, but the final tax amount on the transaction was
             determined outside of AvaTax. To see the tax amounts determined by AvaTax, look at the
             `taxCalculated` field. To see the tax amounts determined by the customer's outside tax engine,
             look at the `taxAmount` field.
             
             This behavior can also occur when a customer requests a refund. For refunds calculated using the
             `RefundTransaction` API, AvaTax will ensure that the exact tax charged to the customer is refunded
             to the customer using a tax amount override.

            AvaTax was instructed to calculate this transaction using the tax rules that were in effect
             on a different day than the transaction occurred.
             
             This behavior typically occurs during refunds. If the customer attempts to return a product
             without a receipt that shows the exact tax amount paid, AvaTax can calculate tax on the date
             when they believed that the product was purchased.

            In the United States, some jurisdictions recognize the address types `pointOfOrderOrigin` and `pointOfOrderAcceptance`.
            These address types affect the sourcing models of some transactions.
             
            If latitude and longitude information is provided for any of these addresses along with line, city, region, country and postal code information,
            we will be using only latitude and longitude and will discard line, city, region, country and postal code information for the transaction.
            Please ensure that you have the correct latitude/longitude information for the addresses prior to using the API.
            If you provide either latitude or longitude information but not both, we will be using the line, city, region, country and postal code information for the addresses.

            <summary>
            A company-distance-threshold model indicates the distance between a company
            and the taxing borders of various countries. Distance thresholds are necessary
            to correctly calculate some value-added taxes.
             
            Distance thresholds only apply to sales of goods in certain countries. A distance threshold
            is applied for each ship-from/ship-to combination of countries. The threshold amount is defined by
            the ship-to country.
             
            Generally, if you have exceeded a distance threshold for taxes between a pair of countries, your tax calculation
            will be determined to be the rate in the destination country. If you have not exceeded the threshold,
            your tax calculation will be determined to be the rate in the origin country.
             
            The amount of a threshold is not tracked or managed in AvaTax, but the decision of your tax compliance department
            as to whether you have exceeded this threshold is maintained in this object.
             
            By default, you are considered to have exceeded tax thresholds. If you wish to change this default, you can create
            a company-distance-threshold object to select the correct behavior for this origin/destination tax calculation process.

            will separate this MultiDocument transaction object into many different transactions, one for each pair of legal

            If you specify a VAT business identification number for the customer in this transaction and you have also set up

            Specifies if the transaction should have value-added and cross-border taxes calculated with the seller as the importer of record.
             
            Some taxes only apply if the seller is the importer of record for a product. In cases where companies are working together to
            ship products, there may be mutual agreement as to which company is the entity designated as importer of record. The importer
            of record will then be the company designated to pay taxes marked as being obligated to the importer of record.
             
            Set this value to `true` to consider your company as the importer of record and collect these taxes.
             
            This value may also be set at the Nexus level. See `NexusModel` for more information.

            Describes an element in the harmonized tariff system.
             
            According to the [United States International Trade Commission](https://www.usitc.gov), the harmonized tariff schedule is defined as follows:
             
            The HTS is a U.S. nomenclature system used to classify traded goods based on their material composition, product name, and/or intended
            function. The HTS is designed so that each article falls into only one category. It is divided into chapters, each of which has a 2-digit
            number. Each product category within the various chapters is designated by 4, 6, 8, or 10 digits. The 4-digit categories are called
            "headings." The 6-, 8- and 10-digit classifications are called "subheadings."
             
            Within AvaTax, the `HsCodeModel` object can refer to sections, chapters, headings, subheadings, or articles. Each object represents one
            classification. Many of these objects have child objects underneath them; these child objects are more specific than their parent objects.

            The harmonized tariff system code for this section and chapter.
             
            A full HS code contains more than six characters. Partial HS codes with two, four, or six characters may have child codes underneath them.
            A child code is one that contains greater specificity than a parent code. It is recommended that when you identify a product you use
            the most detailed code available to identify it.
             
            Top level sections do not have HS Codes.

            A MultiDocument transaction represents a sale or purchase that occurred between more than two companies.
             
            A traditional transaction requires exactly two parties: a seller and a buyer. MultiDocument transactions can
            involve a marketplace of vendors, each of which contributes some portion of the final transaction. Within
            a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate
            document. This separation of documents allows each seller to file their taxes separately.

            Represents a declaration of nexus within a particular taxing jurisdiction.
             
            To create a nexus declaration for your company, you must first call the Definitions API `ListNexus` to obtain a
            list of Avalara-defined nexus. Once you have determined which nexus you wish to declare, you should customize
            only the user-selectable fields in this object.
             
            The user selectable fields for the nexus object are `companyId`, `effectiveDate`, `endDate`, `localNexusTypeId`,
            `taxId`, `nexusTypeId`, `hasPermanentEstablishment`, and `isSellerImporterOfRecord`.
             
            When calling `CreateNexus` or `UpdateNexus`, all values in your nexus object except for the user-selectable fields
            must match an Avalara-defined system nexus object. You can retrieve a list of Avalara-defined system nexus objects
            by calling `ListNexus`. If any data does not match, AvaTax may not recognize your nexus declaration.

            If you are voluntarily declaring nexus in a jurisdiction, you should select `SalesOrSellersUseTax` for your
            nexus type option. This option allows you to calculate tax correctly whether you are selling in-state or

            If you are legally obligated to declare nexus due to physical presence or other sufficient nexus, you
            should select `SalesTax`. This indicates that, as a legal requirement, your company must always collect
            and remit full sales tax in this jurisdiction.

            For nexus declarations at the country level, specifies whether this company is considered the importer of record in this nexus region.
             
            Some taxes only apply if the seller is the importer of record for a product. In cases where companies are working together to
            ship products, there may be mutual agreement as to which company is the entity designated as importer of record. The importer
            of record will then be the company designated to pay taxes marked as being obligated to the importer of record.
             
            Set this value to `true` to consider your company as the importer of record and collect these taxes. Leave this value as false
            or null and taxes will be calculated as if your company is not the importer of record.
             
            This value may also be set during each transaction API call. See `CreateTransaction()` for more information.

            This object is used to keep track of custom information about a company.
             
            The company settings system is a metadata system that you can use to store extra information
            about a company. Your integration or connector could use this data storage to keep track of
            preference information, reminders, or any other storage that would need to persist even if
            the customer uninstalls your application.
             
            A setting can refer to any type of data you need to remember about this company object.
            When creating this object, you may define your own `set`, `name`, and `value` parameters.
            To define your own values, please choose a `set` name that begins with `X-` to indicate an extension.

            Avalara defines some sets that cannot be changed. To create your own set, choose a set
            name that begins with `X-` to indicate that this is an extension value.
             
            We recommend that you choose a set name that clearly identifies your application, and then
            store data within name/value pairs within that set. For example, if you were creating an
            application called MyApp, you might choose to create a set named `X-MyCompany-MyApp`.
