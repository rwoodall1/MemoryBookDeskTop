5. export formats:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3494009/creating-a-custom-export-to-excel-for-reportviewer-rdlcJust a heads up... the accepted answer will render as an XLS file, which was requested by the original poster.

However, you can now export to XLSX as well. You have to change the format parameter of the Render() method from "Excel" to "EXCELOPENXML".

To get a full list of possible values you can call ReportViewer1.LocalReport.ListRenderingExtensions(). When I ran it on my report viewer instance I got these possible options:

"Excel" "EXCELOPENXML" "IMAGE" "PDF" "WORD" "WORDOPENXML"

I found it very hard to determine what you needed to pass in for the formats. MSDN documents this very poorly if you ask me.
